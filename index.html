            <h3 id="headline">Here is a glance at his early career, and how the title revolutionised the gaming world</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Before battle royale games became a popular genre of video games, and when single-player games dominated the gaming industry, a visionary man came up with the idea of PUBG (PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds). He is none other than Brendan Greene, who made history with his creation.</li>


               <li> PUBG changed the gaming scenario of the world, and transformed perspectives of gamers and developers, who thought multiplayer games couldn't make their way into the mainstream sphere. Millions of players started to play the game, and couldn't stop doing so, as the concept was so unique. Gamers kept jumping into matches and exploring PUBG.</li>

               <li>One of the essential qualities of these BR games is the uncertainty of loot, players, and weapons on each map, making for a whole new experience every time gamers log in. After PUBG made the genre famous, many video games like Fortnite, Apex Legends, and Realm Royale followed, becoming popular among fans in no time.</li>
